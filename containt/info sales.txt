482 Hen shows again the diversity of our Janssen stock. 
Her primary lines are those of Schone Blauwe van Links (this means Witplak, 019, Goed Duifje) 
and Zitter (son of the worldfamous Jonge Merckx van ’70). Add to this Goede Jaarling, Raket, 
Stier and Schone Lichten and it will be clear 482 Hen 
is another complete Janssen Arendonk of the finest kind ever bred in the Schoolstraat.

Wondervoske’s red colour comes in a straight line from Vos van ’90 Volière. 
This famous red Janssen Arendonk line is completed in this beautiful hen 
by the lines of Goede Kapot Borstbeen and Rakker. Raket, Blauwen Winterjonge, 
019, Stier, Zitter, Goede Jaarling, Merckx...: all can be found in her pedigree.
 For true Janssen Arendonk fans nothing more needs to be said...

A granddaughter of Beul and Grote Donkeren x Schoon Duivin,
 the lines of our 112 Hen point directly toward icons such as Vos van ’90 Volière, 
Duivin 2 1e Prijzen, 019, Merckx and Stier. 
She has produced some outstanding breeders with her second generation offspring winning on long distance. 
112 Hen is the living proof that Janssen Arendonk 
pigeons can cover all distances and are not merely sprinters.

Braaf Blauw is a full sister of Zoon Septemberman and therefore a daughter of 
Septemberman and granddaughter of Princess. Her parents, Septemberman and Dochter Princess, 
were the two most expensive pigeons in the final sale of the original Janssen 
stock: 40200 and 50600 euro respectively. No wonder, the breeding quality of these birds is legendary.
 Braaf Blauw’s father and mother are both grandparents to 2 times 1st and 3rd National winners. 
A golden combination!

02
-------------------------
This son of Septemberman and grandson of Princess is 
a descendant of worldfamous Janssen birds such as Afgekeurde, 
Eksteroog, Oude Witoger, 019 and Merckx. Zoon Septemberman is a full brother 
to our beautiful hen “Braaf Blauw” and just like her a representative of a modern 
Janssen pigeon with a historic top quality.

This beautiful 2008 cock represents the most recent achievements of the original 
Janssen breeding program. Nevertheless he’s only 4 generations removed from such icons as 019, 
Afgekeurde, Vos van ’90 Volière and Oude Vos van ’81. 
This grandson of Klamper ensures the future of our Janssen breeding loft for the next decade.
Zoon Septemberman ensures our Janssen stock remains up to date.
